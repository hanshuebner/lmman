<index-entry index="concepts" title="handling errors"></index-entry>

<p>The first portion of this chapter explains how programs
can handle errors, by means of condition handlers.  It also explains how
a program can signal an error if it detects something it doesn't like.
</p>

<p>The second explains how users can handle errors, by means of an interactive debugger;
that is, it explains how to recover if you do something wrong.
A new user of the Lisp Machine, or someone who just wants to know how
to deal with errors and not how to cause them, should ignore the first
sections and skip ahead to <ref chapter="31" definition-in-file="debug" key="debugger" section="7" title="The Debugger" type="section"></ref>.
</p>

<p indent="1">        The remaining sections describe some other debugging facilities.
Anyone who is going to be writing programs for the Lisp Machine should
familiarize himself with these.
</p>

<p indent="1">        The <arg>trace</arg> facility provides the ability to perform certain
actions at the time a function is called or at the time it returns.  The
actions may be simple typeout, or more sophisticated debugging functions.
</p>

<p indent="1">        The <arg>advise</arg> facility is a somewhat similar facility for modifying
the behavior of a function.
</p>

<p indent="1">        The <arg>breakon</arg> facility allows you to cause the debugger to be
entered when a certain function is called.  You can then use the debugger's
stepping commands to step to the next function call or return.
</p>

<p indent="1">        The <arg>step</arg> facility allows the evaluation of a form to be
intercepted at every step so that the user may examine just what is happening
throughout the execution of the form.  Stepping works only on interpreted code.
</p>

<p indent="1">        The <arg>MAR</arg> facility provides the ability to cause a trap
on any memory reference to a word (or a set of words) in memory.  If
something is getting clobbered by agents unknown, this can help track
down the source of the clobberage.

<section chapter-number="31" name="condition" number="1" title="Conditions"><index-entry index="concepts" title="condition names"></index-entry>

<index-entry index="concepts" title="conditions"></index-entry>

<index-entry index="concepts" title="condition instances"></index-entry>

<p indent="1">        Programmers often want to control what action is taken by their programs
when errors or other exceptional situations occur.  Usually different situations
are handled in different ways, and in order to express what kind of handling
each situation should have, each situation must have an associated name.  In
Zetalisp, noteworthy events are represented by objects called <arg>condition instances</arg>.
When an event occurs, a condition instance is created; it is then <arg>signaled</arg>, and a
<arg>handler</arg> for that condition may be invoked.
</p>

<p>When a condition is signaled, the system (essentially) searches
up the stack of nested function invocations looking for a handler
established to handle that condition.  The handler is a function that
gets called to deal with the condition.  The condition mechanism itself
is just a convenient way for finding an appropriate handler function
for a particular exceptional situation.
</p>

<p>When a condition is signaled, a <arg>condition instance</arg> is created to represent the
event and hold information about it.  This information includes <arg>condition
names</arg> then classify the condition and any other data that is likely to be of
interest to condition handlers.  A condition instance is immutable once it has
been created.  Some conditions are <arg>errors</arg>, which means that the debugger is
invoked if they are signaled and not handled.
</p>

<p>Condition instances are flavor instances.  The flavor <obj>condition</obj> is the
base flavor from which all flavors of condition are built.  Several
operations that are defined on condition instances are described below.
The flavor <obj>error</obj>, which is built on <obj>condition</obj>, is the base flavor for all kinds of
conditions which are errors. 
</p>

<p>A <arg>condition name</arg> is a symbol then is used to identify a category of conditions.
Each condition instance possesses one or more condition names.  Each condition
handler specifies one or more condition names that it should apply to.  A
handler applies to a condition if they have any condition names in common.
This is the sole purpose of condition names: to match condition instances with
their handlers.  The meaning of every condition name signaled by the system is
described in this manual.  The condition name index is a directory for them.
Conditions that are errors possess the condition name <obj>error</obj>.
</p>

<p>In PL/I, CLU, ADA and most other systems that provide named conditions, each
condition has only one name.  That is to say, the categories identified by
condition names are disjoint.  In Zetalisp, each condition instance can have
multiple condition names, which means that the categories identified by
condition names can overlap and be subdivided.
</p>

<p>For example, among the condition names defined by the system are <obj>condition</obj>,
<obj>error</obj>, <obj>sys:arithmetic-error</obj>, <obj>sys:floating-exponent-underflow</obj> and <obj>sys:divide-by-zero</obj>.
<obj>condition</obj> is a condition name that all condition instances possess.  <obj>error</obj>
identifies the category of conditions that are considered errors.
<obj>sys:arithmetic-error</obj> identifies the category of errors that pertain to arithmetic
operations.  <obj>sys:floating-exponent-underflow</obj> and <obj>sys:divide-by-zero</obj> are the most specific level
of categorization.  So, the condition signaled when you evaluate <obj>(* 1s-30 1s-30 1s-30 1s-30)</obj>
possesses condition names <obj>sys:floating-exponent-underflow</obj>, <obj>sys:arithmetic-error</obj>, <obj>error</obj> and
<obj>condition</obj>, while the one signaled if you evaluate <obj>(// 1 0)</obj> possesses condition
names <obj>sys:divide-by-zero</obj>, <obj>sys:arithmetic-error</obj>, <obj>error</obj> and <obj>condition</obj>.  In this
example, the categories fall into a strict hierarchy, but this does not need to be
the case.
</p>

<p>Condition names are documented throughout the manual, with definitions like this:
</p>
<definition><define key="sys:divide-by-zero-condition" name="sys:divide-by-zero" no-index="1" type="condition"><args>(<obj>sys:arithmetic-error</obj> <obj>error</obj>)</args>
</define>

<description>The condition name <obj>sys:divide-by-zero</obj> is always accompanied by
<obj>sys:arithmetic-error</obj> and <obj>error</obj> (that is, it categorizes a subset of those categories).
The presence of <obj>error</obj> implies that all <obj>sys:divide-by-zero</obj> conditions are errors.
</description></definition>
<p>The condition instance also records additional information about the
event.  For example, the condition instance signaled by dividing by
zero handles the <obj>:function</obj> operation by returning the function
that did the division (it might be <obj>truncate</obj>, <obj>floor</obj>,
<obj>ceiling</obj> or <obj>round</obj>, as well as <obj>//</obj>).  In general, for each
condition name there are conventions saying what additional
information is provided and what operations to use to obtain it.
</p>

<p>The flavor of the condition instance is always one of the condition names, and so
are its component flavors (with a few exceptions; <obj>si:vanilla-flavor</obj> and some
other flavor components are omitted, since they are not useful categories for
condition handlers to specify).  In our example, the flavor of the condition is
<obj>sys:arithmetic-error</obj>, and its components include <obj>error</obj> and <obj>condition</obj>.
Condition names require new flavors only when they require significantly
different handling by the error system; you will understand in detail after
finishing this section.
</p>
<definition><define key="condition-typep-fun" name="condition-typep" type="fun"><args>condition-instance condition-name</args>
</define>

<description>Returns <obj>t</obj> if <arg>condition-instance</arg> possesses condition name <arg>condition-name</arg>.
<arg>condition-name</arg> can also be a combination of condition names using <obj>and</obj>, <obj>or</obj>
and <obj>not</obj>; then the condition tested for is a boolean combination of the
presence or absence of various condition names.  Example:

<lisp>(condition-typep error 'fs:file-not-found)
(condition-typep error 
   '(or fs:file-not-found fs:directory-not-found))
</lisp></description></definition><definition><define key="errorp-fun" name="errorp" type="fun"><args>object</args>
</define>

<description>Returns <obj>t</obj> if <arg>object</arg> is a condition instance and its flavor incorporates <obj>error</obj>.
This is normally equivalent to <obj>(typep <arg>object</arg> 'error)</obj>.  Some functions such as
<obj>open</obj> optionally return the condition instance rather than signaling it, if an error
occurs.  <obj>errorp</obj> is useful in testing the value returned.
</description></definition><definition>
<define key="condition-condition-names-method" name="condition" method-name="condition-names" type="method"></define>

<description>Returns a list of all the condition names possesses by this condition instance.
</description></definition></section><a name="condition-handlers"></a>


<section chapter-number="31" name="condition-handlers" number="2" title="Handling Conditions"><index-entry index="concepts" title="condition handlers"></index-entry>

<p>A condition handler is a function that is associated with certain
condition names (categories of conditions).  The variable
<obj>eh:condition-handlers</obj> contains a list of the handlers that are current;
handlers are established using macros which bind this variable.  When a condition is
signaled, this list is scanned and all the handlers which apply are called,
one by one, until one of the handlers either throws or returns non-<obj>nil</obj>.
</p>

<p>Since each new handler is pushed onto the front of <obj>eh:condition-handlers</obj>, the
innermost-established handler gets the first chance to handle the condition.
When the handler is run, <obj>eh:condition-handlers</obj> is bound so that the running
handler (and all the ones that were established farther in) are not in effect.  This
avoids the danger of infinite recursion due to an error in a handler invoking the
same handler.
</p>

<p>One thing a handler can do is throw to a tag.  Often the <obj>catch</obj> for this
tag is right next to the place where the handler is established, but this
does not have to be so.  A simple handler that applies to all errors and just
throws to a tag is established using <obj>ignore-errors</obj>.
</p>
<definition><define key="ignore-errors-fun" name="ignore-errors" type="mac"><args>body...</args>
</define>

<description>An error within the execution of <arg>body</arg> causes control to return
from the <obj>ignore-errors</obj> form.  In this case, the values are
<obj>nil</obj>, <obj>t</obj>.  If there is no error inside <arg>body</arg>, the first value
is that of the last form in the <arg>body</arg> and the second is <obj>nil</obj>.

Errors whose condition instances return true for the <obj>:dangerous-condition-p</obj> operation
are not handled.  These include such things as running out of virtual memory.
</description></definition>
<p>A handler can also signal another condition.  For example, signaling <obj>sys:abort</obj>
has the effect of pretending that the user typed the <obj>Abort</obj> key.  The following
function creates a handler which signals <obj>sys:abort</obj>.
</p>
<definition><define key="si:eval-abort-trivial-errors-fun" name="si:eval-abort-trivial-errors" type="fun"><args>form</args>
</define>

<description>Evaluates <arg>form</arg> with a condition handler for many common error conditions such as
<obj>:wrong-type-argument</obj>, <obj>:unbound-variable</obj> and <obj>:unclaimed-message</obj>.
The handler asks the user whether to allow the debugger to be entered.
If the user says `no', the handler signals the <obj>sys:abort</obj> condition.  If the user
says `yes', the handler does not handle the condition, allowing the debugger
to do so.

In some cases the handler attempts to determine whether the incorrect variable,
operation, or argument appeared in <arg>form</arg>; if it did not, the debugger is always
allowed to run.  The assumption is that <arg>form</arg> was typed in by the user, and
the intention is to distinguish trivial mistakes from program bugs.
</description></definition>
<p>The handler can also ask to proceed from the condition.  This is done by
returning a non-<obj>nil</obj> value.  See the section on proceeding, <ref definition-in-file="errors" key="proceeding" type="page"></ref>, for
more information.
</p>

<p>The handler can also decline to handle the condition, by returning <obj>nil</obj>.
Then the next applicable handler is called, and so on until either some
handler does handle the condition or there are no more handlers.
</p>

<p>The handler function is called in the environment where the condition
was signaled, and in the same stack group.  All special variables have the
values they had at the place where the signaling was done, and all catch
tags that were available at the point of signaling may be thrown to.
</p>

<p>The handler receives the condition instance as its first argument.  When
establishing the handler, you can also provide additional arguments to
pass to the handler when it is called.  This allows the same function to
be used in varying circumstances.
</p>

<p>The fundamental means of establishing a condition handler is the macro
<obj>condition-bind</obj>.
</p>
<definition><define key="condition-bind-fun" name="condition-bind" type="mac"><args>(handlers...) body...</args>
</define><define key="condition-bind-default-fun" name="condition-bind-default" type="mac"><args>(handlers...) body...</args>
</define>

<description>A <obj>condition-bind</obj> form looks like this:

<lisp>(condition-bind ((<arg>conditions</arg> <arg>handler-form</arg> <arg>additional-arg-forms</arg>...)
                 (<arg>conditions</arg> <arg>handler-form</arg> <arg>additional-arg-forms</arg>...))
  <arg>body</arg>...)
</lisp>
The purpose is to execute <arg>body</arg> with one or more condition handlers
established.

Each list of conditions and handler-form establishes one handler.
<arg>conditions</arg> is a condition name or a list of condition names to which the
handler should apply.  It is <arg>not</arg> evaluated.  <arg>handler-form</arg> is evaluated to
produce the function that is the actual handler.  The
<arg>additional-arg-forms</arg> are evaluated, on entry to the <obj>condition-bind</obj>, to
produce additional arguments that are passed to the handler
function when it is called.  The arguments to the handler function are
the condition instance being signaled, followed by the values of any
<arg>additional-arg-forms</arg>.

<arg>conditions</arg> can be <obj>nil</obj>; then the handler applies to all conditions that
are signaled.  In this case it is up to the handler function to decide whether to
do anything.  It is important for the handler to refrain from handling
certain conditions that are used for debugging, such as <obj>break</obj> and
<obj>eh:call-trap</obj>.  The <obj>:debugging-condition-p</obj> operation on condition
instances returns non-<obj>nil</obj> for these conditions.  Certain other
conditions such as <obj>sys:virtual-memory-overflow</obj> should be handled only
with great care.  The <obj>:dangerous-condition-p</obj> operation returns non-<obj>nil</obj>
for these conditions.  Example:


<lisp>(condition-bind ((nil 'myhandler &quot;it happened here&quot; 45))
  (catch 'x
    ...))

(defun myhandler (condition string value)
  (unless (or (condition-typep condition 'fs:file-error)
              (send condition :dangerous-condition-p)
              (send condition :debugging-condition-p))
    (format error-output &quot;~&amp;~A:~%~A~%&quot; string condition)
    (throw 'x value)))
</lisp>
<obj>myhandler</obj> declines to handle file errors, and all debugging conditions and
dangerous errors.  For all other conditions, it prints the string specified
in the condition bind and throws to the tag <obj>x</obj> the value specified there (45).

<obj>condition-bind-default</obj> is like <obj>condition-bind</obj> but establishes a <arg>default</arg> <arg>handler</arg>
instead of an ordinary handler.  Default handlers work like ordinary handlers, but
they are tried in a different order: first all the applicable ordinary handlers are
given a chance to handle the condition, and then the default handlers get their
chance.  A more flexible way of doing things like this is described under
<obj>signal-condition</obj> (<ref definition-in-file="errors" key="signal-condition-fun" title="Function signal-condition" type="fun"></ref>).
</description></definition>
<p>Condition handlers that simply throw to the function that established
them are very common, so there are special constructs provided for
defining them.
</p>
<definition><define key="condition-case-fun" name="condition-case" type="mac"><args>(variables...) body-form clauses...</args>
</define>


<description><lisp>(condition-case (<arg>variable</arg>)
    <arg>body-form</arg>
  (<arg>condition-names</arg> <arg>forms</arg>...)
  (<arg>condition-names</arg> <arg>forms</arg>...)
  ...)
</lisp><arg>body-form</arg> is executed with a condition handler established that will
throw back to the <obj>condition-case</obj> if any of the specified condition names
is signaled.

Each list starting with some condition names is a <arg>clause</arg>, and specifies
what to do if one of those condition names is signaled.  <arg>condition-names</arg>
is either a condition name or a list of condition names; it is not
evaluated.

Once the handler per se has done the throw, the clauses are tested in
order until one is found that applies.  This is almost like a <obj>selectq</obj>,
except that the signaled condition can have several condition names, so
the first clause that matches any of them gets to run.  The forms in the
clause are executed with <arg>variable</arg> bound to the condition instance that
was signaled.  The values of the last form in the clause are returned
from the <obj>condition-case</obj> form.

If none of the specified conditions is signaled during the execution of
<arg>body-form</arg> (or if other handlers, established within <arg>body-form</arg>, handle
them) then the values of <arg>body-form</arg> are returned from the
<obj>condition-case</obj> form.

<arg>variable</arg> may be omitted if it is not used.

It is also possible to have a clause starting with <obj>:no-error</obj> in place of a
condition name.  This clause is executed if <arg>body-form</arg> finishes normally.
Instead of just one <arg>variable</arg> there can be several variables; during the
execution of the <obj>:no-error</obj> clause, these are bound to the values returned
by <arg>body-form</arg>.  The values of the last form in the clause become the
values of the <obj>condition-case</obj> form.

Here is an example:

<lisp>(condition-case ()
    (print foo)
  (error (format t &quot; &lt;&lt;Error in printing&gt;&gt;&quot;)))
</lisp></description></definition><definition><define key="condition-call-fun" name="condition-call" type="mac"><args>(variables...) body-form clauses...</args>
</define>

<description><obj>condition-call</obj> is an extension of <obj>condition-case</obj> that allows you to
give each clause an arbitrary conditional expression instead of just a list
of condition names.  It looks like this:

<lisp>(condition-call (<arg>variables</arg>...)
    <arg>body-form</arg>
  (<arg>test</arg> <arg>forms</arg>...)
  (<arg>test</arg> <arg>forms</arg>...)
  ...)
</lisp>The difference between this and <obj>condition-case</obj> is the <arg>test</arg> in
each clause.  The clauses in a <obj>condition-call</obj> resemble the clauses of a
<obj>cond</obj> rather than those of a <obj>selectq</obj>.

When a condition is signaled, each <arg>test</arg> is executed while still within the
environment of the signaling (that is, within the actual handler function).  The
condition instance can be found in the first <arg>variable</arg>.  If any <arg>test</arg> returns
non-<obj>nil</obj>, then the handler throws to the <obj>condition-call</obj> and the corresponding
clause's <arg>forms</arg> are executed.  If every <arg>test</arg> returns <obj>nil</obj>, the condition is not
handled by this handler.

In fact, each <arg>test</arg> is computed a second time after the throw has
occurred in order to decide which clause to execute.  The code for the
<arg>test</arg> is copied in two different places, once into the handler
function to decide whether to throw, and once in a <obj>cond</obj> which follows
the catch.

The last clause can be a <obj>:no-error</obj> clause just as in <obj>condition-case</obj>.
It is executed if the body returns without error.
The values returned by the body are stored in the <arg>variables</arg>.
The values of the last form in the <obj>:no-error</obj> clause are returned by the
<obj>condition-call</obj>.

Only the first of <arg>variables</arg> is used if there is no <obj>:no-error</obj> clause.
The <arg>variables</arg> may be omitted entirely in the unlikely event that none is used.
Example:

<lisp>(condition-call (instance)
    (do-it)
  ((condition-typep instance
     '(and fs:file-error (not fs:no-more-room)))
   (compute-what-to-return)))
</lisp>The condition name <obj>fs:no-more-room</obj> is a subcategory of
<obj>fs:file-error</obj>; therefore, this handles all file errors <arg>except</arg> for
<obj>fs:no-more-room</obj>.
</description></definition>
<p>Each of the four condition handler establishing constructs has a
conditional version that decides at run time whether to establish the
handlers.

<define key="condition-flavor" name="condition" type="flavor"></define>

<description>The flavor <obj>condition</obj> is the base flavor of all conditions, and provides default
definitions for all the operations described in this chapter.

<obj>condition</obj> incorporates <obj>si:property-list-mixin</obj>, which defines operations
<obj>:get</obj> and <obj>:plist</obj>.  Each property name on the property list is also an operation
name, so that sending the <obj>:foo</obj> message is equivalent to
<obj>(send instance :get :foo)</obj>.  In addition, <obj>(send instance :set :foo <arg>value</arg>)</obj> is equivalent
to <obj>(send instance :set :get :foo <arg>value</arg>)</obj>.

<obj>condition</obj> also provides two instance variables, <obj>eh:format-string</obj> and <obj>eh:format-args</obj>.
<obj>condition</obj>'s method for the the <obj>:report</obj> operation passes these to <obj>format</obj> to print
the error message.

<section chapter-number="31" name="Condition Operations" number="4" title="Condition Operations"><p>Every condition instance can be asked to print an <arg>error message</arg> which describes
the circumstances that led to the signaling of the condition.  The easiest way
to print one is to print the condition instance without escaping (<obj>princ</obj>, or
<obj>format</obj> operation <obj>~A</obj>).  This actually uses the <obj>:report</obj> operation, which
implements the printing of an error message.  When a condition instance is
printed with escaping, it uses the <obj>#⊂</obj> syntax so that it can be read back in.

<subsection name="NIL" title="Condition Operations for the Debugger"><p>Some operations are intended for the debugger to use.  They are documented
because some flavors of condition redefine them so as to cause the debugger to

<definition><define key="condition-print-error-message-method" name="condition" method-name="print-error-message" type="method"><args>stack-group brief-flag stream</args>
</define>

<description>This operation is used by the debugger to print a complete error message.  This
is done primarily using the <obj>:report</obj> operation.

Certain flavors of condition define a <obj>:after</obj> <obj>:print-error-message</obj> method which,
when <arg>brief-flag</arg> is <obj>nil</obj>, prints additional helpful information which is not part of
the error message per se.  Often this requires access to the stack group in
addition to the data in the condition instance.  The method can assume that if
<arg>brief-flag</arg> is <obj>nil</obj> then <arg>stack-group</arg> is not the one which is executing.

For example, the <obj>:print-error-message</obj> method of the condition signaled when you call
an undefined function checks for the case of calling a function such as <obj>bind</obj>
that is meaningful only in compiled code; if that is what happened, it searches
the stack to look for the name of the function in which the call appears.  This is
information that is not considered crucial to the error itself, and is therefore
not recorded in the condition instance.

</description></definition><definition><define key="condition-find-current-frame-method" name="condition" method-name="find-current-frame" type="method"><args>stack-group</args>
</define>

<description>Returns the stack indices of the stack frames that the debugger should operate
on.

The first value is the frame ``at which the error occurred.''  This is not the
innermost stack frame; it is outside the calls to such functions as <obj>ferror</obj> and
<obj>signal-condition</obj> which were used to signal the error.

The second value is the initial value for the debugger command loop's current
frame.

The third value is the innermost frame that the debugger should be willing to let the
user see.  By default this is the innermost active frame, but it is safe to use
an open but not active frame within it.

The fourth value, if non-<obj>nil</obj>, tells the debugger to consider the innermost frame
to be ``interesting''.  Normally, frames that are part of the interpreter (calls to
<obj>si:eval1</obj>, <obj>si:apply-lambda</obj>, <obj>prog</obj>, <obj>cond</obj>, etc.) are considered uninteresting.

This is a flavor operation so that certain flavors of condition can redefine it.
</description></definition><definition><define key="condition-debugger-command-loop-method" name="condition" method-name="debugger-command-loop" type="method"><args>stack-group <standard>&amp;optional</standard> error-object</args>

<description>Enters the debugger command loop.  The initial error message and backtrace have
already been printed.  This message is sent in an error handler stack group;
<arg>stack-group</arg> is the stack group in which the condition was signaled.  <arg>error-object</arg>
is the condition object which was signaled; it defaults to the one the message is
sent to.

This operation uses <obj>:or</obj> method combination (see <ref chapter="22" definition-in-file="flavor" key="method-combination" section="11" title="Method Combination" type="section"></ref>).
Some condition flavors add methods that perform some other sort of
processing or enter a different command loop.  For example, unbound variable
errors look for look-alike symbols in other packages at this point.  If the added
method returns <obj>nil</obj>, the original method that enters the usual debugger
command loop is called.
</description></definition></subsection></section><a name="Signaling Conditions"></a>


<section chapter-number="31" name="Signaling Conditions" number="5" title="Signaling Conditions"><index-entry index="concepts" title="signaling conditions"></index-entry>

<p>Signaling a condition has two steps, creating a condition instance and signaling
the instance.  There are convenience interface functions that combine the two
steps.  You can also do them separately.  If you just want to signal an error and
do not want to worry much about condition handling, the function <obj>ferror</obj> is all
you need to know.
</p>


<subsection name="NIL" title="Convenience Functions for Signaling"><definition><define key="ferror-fun" name="ferror" type="fun"><args><standard>&amp;rest</standard> make-condition-arguments</args>
</define>

<description>Creates a condition instance using <obj>make-condition</obj> and then signals it
with <obj>signal-condition</obj>, specifying no local proceed types, and with <obj>t</obj> as the
<arg>use-debugger</arg> argument so the debugger is always entered if the condition is not
otherwise handled.

The first argument to <obj>ferror</obj> is always a signal name (often <obj>nil</obj>).  The second
argument is usually a format string and the remaining arguments are additional
arguments for <obj>format</obj>; but this is under the control of the definition of the
signal name.  Example:

<lisp>(ferror 'math:singular-matrix
        &quot;The matrix ~S cannot be inverted.&quot; matrix)
</lisp>For compatibility with the Symbolics system, if the first argument to <obj>ferror</obj> is a
string, then a signal name of <obj>nil</obj> is assumed.  The arguments to <obj>ferror</obj> are passed
on to <obj>make-condition</obj> with an additional <obj>nil</obj> preceding them.

If you prefer, you can use the formatted output functions
(<ref definition-in-file="fd-fio" key="format:outfmt-fun" title="Macro format:outfmt" type="mac"></ref>) to generate the error message.  Here is an example,
though in a simple case like this using <obj>format</obj> is easier:

<lisp>(ferror 'math:singular-matrix
  (format:outfmt
    &quot;The matrix &quot;
    (prin1 matrix)
    &quot; cannot be inverted.&quot;)
  number)
</lisp>In this case, arguments past the second one are not used for printing the error
message, but the signal name may still expect them to be present so it can put
them in the condition instance.
</description></definition><definition><define key="cerror-fun" name="cerror" type="fun"><args>proceed-type ignore signal-name <standard>&amp;rest</standard> signal-name-arguments</args>
</define>

<description>Creates a condition instance, by passing the <arg>signal-name</arg> and
<arg>signal-name-arguments</arg> to <obj>make-condition</obj>, and then signals it.
If <arg>proceed-type</arg> is non-<obj>nil</obj> then it is provided to
<obj>signal-condition</obj> as a proceed type.  For compatibility with old
uses of <obj>cerror</obj>, if <arg>proceed-type</arg> is <obj>t</obj>, <obj>:new-value</obj> is
provided as the proceed type.  If <arg>proceed-type</arg> is <obj>:yes</obj>,
<obj>:no-action</obj> is provided as the proceed type.

The second argument to <obj>cerror</obj> is not used and is present for historical
compatibility.  It may be given a new meaning in the future.

If a condition handler or the debugger decides to proceed, the second value it
returns becomes the value of <obj>cerror</obj>.

Common Lisp defines another calling sequence for this function:

<lisp>(cerror <arg>continue-format-string</arg> <arg>error-format-string</arg> <arg>args</arg>...)
</lisp>This signals an error of flavor <obj>eh:common-lisp-cerror</obj>, which prints an
error message using <arg>error-format-string</arg> and <arg>args</arg>.  It allows one proceed type,
whose documentation is <arg>continue-format-string</arg>, and which proceeds silently,
returning <obj>nil</obj> from <obj>cerror</obj>.
<obj>cerror</obj> can tell which calling sequence has been used and behaves accordingly.

</define><define key="check-arg-type-fun" name="check-arg-type" type="mac"><args>place type-spec [description]</args>
</define>


<description><index-entry index="concepts" title="argument checking"></index-entry>
Signals a correctable error if the value of <arg>place</arg> does not
fit the type <arg>type-spec</arg>.  <arg>place</arg> is something that <obj>setf</obj> can store in.
<arg>type-spec</arg> is a type specifier, a suitable second argument to <obj>typep</obj>,
and is not evaluated (see <ref chapter="2" definition-in-file="fd-dtp" key="type-specifiers" section="3" title="Type Specifiers" type="section"></ref>).  A simple example is:

<lisp>(check-type foo (integer 0 10))
</lisp>This signals an error unless <obj>(typep foo '(integer 0 10))</obj>; that is, unless
<obj>foo</obj>'s value is an integer between zero and ten, inclusive.

If an error is signaled, the error message contains the name of the variable or
place where the erroneous value was found, and the erroneous value itself.  An
English description of the type of object that was wanted is computed
automatically from the type specifier for use in the error message.  For the
commonly used type specifiers this computed description is adequate.  If it is
unsatisfactory in a particular case, you can specify <arg>description</arg>, which is used
instead.  In order to make the error message grammatical, <arg>description</arg> should start
with an indefinite article.

The error signaled is of condition <obj>sys:wrong-type-argument</obj> (see
<ref definition-in-file="fd-eva" key="sys:wrong-type-argument-condition" title="Condition sys:wrong-type-argument" type="condition"></ref>).  The proceed type <obj>:argument-value</obj> is
provided.  If a handler proceeds using this proceed type, it should specify one
additional argument; that value is stored into <arg>place</arg> with <obj>setf</obj>.  The new value is
then tested, and so on.  <obj>check-type</obj> returns when a value passes the test.

<obj>check-arg-type</obj> is an older name for this macro.
</description></definition><definition><define key="check-arg-fun" name="check-arg" type="mac"><args>var-name predicate description [type-symbol]</args>
</define>

<description><obj>check-arg</obj> is an obsolete variant of <obj>check-type</obj>.
<arg>predicate</arg> is either a symbol which is predicate (a function of one argument)
or a list which is a form.  If it is a predicate, it is applied to the
value of <arg>var-name</arg>, which is valid if the predicate returns non-<obj>nil</obj>.
If it is a form, it is evaluated, and the value is valid of the form
returns non-<obj>nil</obj>.  The form ought to make use of <arg>var-name</arg>, but
nothing checks this.

There is no way to compute an English description of valid values
from <arg>predicate</arg>, so a <arg>description</arg> string must always be supplied.

<arg>type-symbol</arg> is a symbol that is used by condition handlers to determine what type
of argument was expected.  If <arg>predicate</arg> is a symbol, you may omit <arg>type-symbol</arg>, and
<arg>predicate</arg> is used for that purpose as well.  The use of the <arg>type-symbol</arg> is not really
well-defined, and <obj>check-type</obj>, where a type specifier serves both purposes,
is superior to <obj>check-arg</obj> for this reason.

</define>

<description>Signals an error if <arg>test-form</arg> evaluates to <obj>nil</obj>.  The rest of the <obj>assert</obj> form is
relevant only if the error happens.

First of all, the <arg>places</arg> are forms that can be stored into with <obj>setf</obj>, and which are used
(presumably) in <arg>test-form</arg>.  The reason that the <arg>places</arg> are specified again
in the <obj>assert</obj> is so that the expanded code can arrange for the user to
be able to specify a new value to be stored into any one of them when
he proceeds from the error.  When the error is signaled, one proceed-type
is provided for each <arg>place</arg> that is given.  The condition object has flavor
<obj>eh:failed-assertion</obj>.

If the user does proceed with a new value in that fashion, the <arg>test-form</arg> is
evaluated again, and the error repeats until the <arg>test-form</arg> comes out non-<obj>nil</obj>.

The <arg>string</arg> and <arg>args</arg> are used to print the error message.  If they are omitted,
<obj>&quot;Failed assertion&quot;</obj> is used.  They are evaluated only when an error is signaled,
and are evaluated again each time an error is signaled.  <obj>setf</obj>'ing the <arg>places</arg> may
also involve evaluation, which happens each time the user proceeds and sets one.

<subsection name="NIL" title="Creating Condition Instances"><p>You can create a condition instance quite satisfactorily with <obj>make-instance</obj> if
you know which instance variables to initialize.  For example,

<lisp>(make-instance 'ferror :condition-names '(foo)
               :format-string &quot;~S loses.&quot;
               :format-args losing-object)
</lisp>creates an instance of <obj>ferror</obj> just like the one that would be signaled if you do

<lisp>(ferror 'foo &quot;~S loses.&quot; losing-object)
</lisp></p>

<p>Note that the flavor name and its components' names are added in automatically
to whatever you specify for the <obj>:condition-names</obj> keyword.
</p>

<index-entry index="concepts" title="signal names"></index-entry>

<p>Direct use of <obj>make-instance</obj> is cumbersome, however, and it is usually handier
to define a <arg>signal</arg> <arg>name</arg> with <obj>defsignal</obj> or <obj>defsignal-explicit</obj> and then create the
instance with <obj>make-condition</obj>.
</p>

<p>A signal name is a sort of abbreviation for all the things that are always the same
for a certain sort of condition: the flavor to use, the condition names, and what
arguments are expected.  In addition, it allows you to use a positional syntax for
the arguments, which is usually more convenient than a keyword syntax in
simple use.
</p>

<p>Here is a typical <obj>defsignal</obj>:

<lisp>(defsignal series-not-convergent sys:arithmetic-error (series)
  &quot;Signaled by limit extractor when SERIES does not converge.&quot;)
</lisp>This defines a signal name <obj>series-not-convergent</obj>, together with the name of the
flavor to use (<obj>sys:arithmetic-error</obj>, whose meaning is being stretched a little),
an interpretation for the arguments (<obj>series</obj>, which is explained below),
and a documentation string.  The documentation string is not used in printing
the error message; it is documentation for the signal name.  It becomes accessible
via <obj>(documentation 'series-not-convergent 'signal)</obj>.
</p>

<p><obj>series-not-convergent</obj> could then be used to signal an error, or just to create a
condition instance:
</p>

<lisp>(ferror 'series-not-convergent
        &quot;The series ~S went to infinity.&quot; myseries)

(make-condition 'series-not-convergent
                &quot;The series ~S went to infinity.&quot; myseries)
</lisp>
<p>The list <obj>(series)</obj> in the <obj>defsignal</obj> is a list of implicit instance variable
names.  They are matched against arguments to <obj>make-condition</obj> following the
format string, and each implicit instance variable name becomes an operation
defined on the condition instance to return the corresponding argument.  (You
can imagine that <obj>:gettable-instance-variables</obj> is in effect for all the implicit
instance variables.)  In this example, sending a <obj>:series</obj> message to the condition
instance returns the value specified via <obj>myseries</obj> when the condition was
signaled.  The implicit instance variables are actually implemented using the

<description>Defines <arg>signal-name</arg> to create an instance of <arg>flavor</arg> with condition names
<arg>condition-names</arg>, and implicit instance variable whose names are taken from the list
<arg>implicit-instance-variables</arg> and whose values are taken from the <obj>make-condition</obj> arguments
following the format string.

Instead of a list <obj>(<arg>flavor</arg></obj> <arg>condition-names<obj>...)</obj></arg> there may appear just a flavor name.
This is equivalent to using <arg>signal-name</arg> as the sole condition name.

The<arg> extra-init-keyword-forms</arg> are forms to be evaluated to produce additional
keyword arguments to pass to <obj>make-instance</obj>.  These can be used to initialize
other instance variables that particular flavors may have.  These expressions can
refer to the <arg>implicit-instance-variables</arg>.

<arg>documentation</arg> is a string which is recorded so that it can be accessed via
the function <obj>documentation</obj>, as in <obj>(documentation <arg>signal-name</arg> 'signal)</obj>.

<description>Like <obj>defsignal</obj>, <obj>defsignal-explicit</obj> defines a signal name.  This signal name is
used the same way, but the way it goes about creating the condition instance is
different.

First of all, there is no list of implicit instance variables.  Instead, <arg>signal-arglist</arg> is
a lambda list which is matched up against all the arguments to <obj>make-condition</obj>
except for the signal-name itself.  The variables bound by the lambda list can
be used in the <arg>init-keyword-forms</arg>, which are evaluated to get arguments to pass
to <obj>make-instance</obj>.  For example:

<lisp>(defsignal-explicit mysignal-3 
           (my-error-flavor mysignal-3 my-signals-category)
           (format-string losing-object &amp;rest format-args)
  &quot;The third kind of thing I like to signal.&quot;
  :format-string format-string
  :format-args (cons losing-object (copylist format-args))
  :losing-object-name (send losing-object :name))
</lisp>Since implicit instance variables are really just properties on the property list of
the instance, you can create them by using init keyword <obj>:property-list</obj>.  The
contents of the property list determines what implicit instance variables exist
and their values.
</description></definition><definition><define key="make-condition-fun" name="make-condition" type="fun"><args>signal-name <standard>&amp;rest</standard> arguments</args>
</define>

<description><obj>make-condition</obj> is the fundamental way that condition instances are created.
The <arg>signal-name</arg> says how to interpret the <arg>arguments</arg> and come up with a flavor
and values for its instance variables.  The handling of the <arg>arguments</arg> is
entirely determined by the <arg>signal-name</arg>.

If <arg>signal-name</arg> is a condition instance, <obj>make-condition</obj> returns it.
It is not useful to call <obj>make-condition</obj> this way explicitly, but this allows
condition instances to be passed to the convenience functions <obj>error</obj> and <obj>signal</obj>
which call <obj>make-condition</obj>.

If the <arg>signal-name</arg> was defined with <obj>defsignal</obj> or <obj>defsignal-explicit</obj>, then that
definition specifies exactly how to interpret the <arg>arguments</arg> and create the
instance.  In general, if the <arg>signal-name</arg> has an <obj>eh:make-condition-function</obj>
property (which is what <obj>defsignal</obj> defines), this property is a function to which
the <arg>signal-name</arg> and <arg>arguments</arg> are passed, and it does the work.

Alternatively, the <arg>signal-name</arg> can be the name of a flavor.  Then the <arg>arguments</arg>
are passed to <obj>make-instance</obj>, which interprets them as init keywords and values.
This mode is not really recommended and exists for compatibility with
Symbolics software.

If the <arg>signal-name</arg> has no <obj>eh:make-condition-function</obj> property and is not a
flavor name, then a trivial <obj>defsignal</obj> is assumed as a default.  It looks like this:

<lisp>(defsignal <arg>signal-name</arg> ferror ())
</lisp>So the value is an instance of <obj>ferror</obj>, with the <arg>signal-name</arg> as a condition name,
and the <arg>arguments</arg> are interpreted as a format string and args for it.

The <arg>signal-name</arg> <obj>nil</obj> actually has a definition of this form.  <obj>nil</obj> is frequently used
as a signal name in the function <obj>ferror</obj> when there is no desire to use any
condition name in particular.

<subsection name="NIL" title="Signaling a Condition Instance"><p>Once you have a condition instance, you are ready to invoke the condition

</define>

<description>Invoke the condition handling mechanism on <arg>condition-instance</arg>.
The list of <arg>proceed-types</arg> says which proceed types (among those conventionally
defined for the type of condition you have signaled) you are prepared to
implement, should a condition handler return one (see ``proceeding'').
These are in addition to any proceed types implemented nonlocally by
<obj>condition-resume</obj> forms.

<arg>ucode-error-status</arg> is used for internal purposes in signaling errors detected by
the microcode.
</description></definition>
<p><obj>signal-condition</obj> tries various possible handlers for the
condition.  First <obj>eh:condition-handlers</obj> is scanned for handlers
that are applicable (according to the condition names they specify) to
this condition instance.  After this list is exhausted,
<obj>eh:condition-default-handlers</obj> is scanned the same way.  Each
handler that is tried can terminate the act of signaling by throwing
out of <obj>signal-condition</obj>, or it can specify a way to proceed from
the signal.  The handler can also return <obj>nil</obj> to decline to handle the condition;
then the next possible handler is offered a chance.
</p>

<p>If all handlers decline to handle the condition and
<arg>invoke-debugger</arg> is non-<obj>nil</obj>, the debugger is the handler of
last resort.  With the debugger, the user can ask to throw or to
proceed.  The default value of <arg>invoke-debugger</arg> is non-<obj>nil</obj> if
the <arg>condition-instance</arg> is an error.
</p>

<p>If all handlers decline to act and <arg>invoke-debugger</arg> is <obj>nil</obj>,
<obj>signal-condition</obj> proceeds using the first proceed type on the list
of available ones, provided it is a nonlocal proceed type.  If it is a
local proceed type, or if there are no proceed types,
<obj>signal-condition</obj> just returns <obj>nil</obj>.  (It would be slightly
simpler to proceed using the first proceed type whether it is local or
not.  But in the case of a local proceed type, this would just mean
returning the proceed type instead of <obj>nil</obj>.  It is considered
slightly more useful to return <obj>nil</obj>, allowing the signaler to
distinguish the case of a condition not handled.  The signaler knows
which proceed types it specified, and can if it wishes consider <obj>nil</obj> as
equivalent to the first of them.)
</p>

<p>Otherwise, by this stage, a proceed type has been chosen from the available list.
If the proceed type was among those specified by the caller of <obj>signal-condition</obj>,
then proceeding consists simply of returning to that caller.  The chosen proceed
type is the first value, and arguments (returned by the handler along with the
proceed type) may follow it.  If the proceed type was implemented nonlocally
with <obj>condition-resume</obj> (see <ref definition-in-file="errors" key="condition-resume-fun" title="Macro condition-resume" type="mac"></ref>), then the associated
proceed handler function on <obj>eh:condition-resume-handlers</obj> is called.
</p>

<p>If <arg>inhibit-resume-handlers</arg> is non-<obj>nil</obj>, resume handlers are not invoked.  If a
handler returns a nonlocal proceed type, <obj>signal-condition</obj> just returns to its caller
as if the proceed type were local.  If the condition is not handled,
<obj>signal-condition</obj> returns <obj>nil</obj>.
</p>

<p>The purpose of <obj>condition-bind-default</obj> is so that you can define a
handler that is allowed to handle a signal only if none of the callers' handlers handle it.
A more flexible technique for doing this sort of thing is to make an ordinary
handler signal the same condition instance recursively by calling
<obj>signal-condition</obj>, like this:

<lisp>(multiple-value-list 
  (signal-condition <arg>condition-instance</arg>
                    eh:condition-proceed-types nil nil t))
</lisp>This passes along the same list of proceed types specified by the original
signaler, prevents the debugger from being called, and prevents resume handlers
from being run.  If the first value <obj>signal-condition</obj> returns is non-<obj>nil</obj>, one of
the outer handlers has handled the condition; your handler's simplest option is to
return those same values so that the other handler has its way (but it could
also examine them and return modified values).  Otherwise, you go on to handle
the condition in your default manner.

<section chapter-number="31" name="nonlocal-proceed" number="6" title="Proceeding"><index-entry index="concepts" title="proceed types"></index-entry>

<p>Both condition handlers and the user (through the debugger) have the
option of proceeding certain conditions.
</p>

<p>Each condition name can define, as a convention, certain <arg>proceed types</arg>, which are
keywords that signify a certain conceptual way to proceed.  For example,
condition name <obj>sys:wrong-type-argument</obj> defines the proceed type
<obj>:argument-value</obj> which means, ``Here is a new value to use as the argument.''
</p>

<p>Each signaler may or may not implement all the proceed types which are
meaningful in general for the condition names being signaled.  For example, it is
futile to proceed from a <obj>sys:wrong-type-argument</obj> error with <obj>:argument-value</obj>
unless the signaler knows how to take the associated value and store it into the
argument, or do something else that fits the conceptual specifications of
<obj>:argument-value</obj>.  For some signalers, it may not make sense to do this at all.
Therefore, one of the arguments to <obj>signal-condition</obj> is a list of the proceed
types that this particular signaler knows how to handle.
</p>

<p>In addition to the proceed types specified by the individual signaler, other
proceed types can be provided nonlocally; they are implemented by a <arg>resume
handler</arg> which is in effect through a dynamic scope.  See below,
<ref chapter="31" definition-in-file="errors" key="nonlocal-proceed" section="6" title="Proceeding" type="section"></ref>.
</p>

<p>A condition handler can use the operations <obj>:proceed-types</obj> and <obj>:proceed-type-p</obj>
on the condition instance to find out which proceed types are available.  It can
request to proceed by returning one of the available proceed types as a value.
This value is returned from <obj>signal-condition</obj>, and the condition's signaler can
take action as appropriate.
</p>

<p>If the handler returns more than one value, the remaining values are
considered <arg>arguments</arg> of the proceed type.  The meaning of the
arguments to a proceed type, and what sort of arguments are expected,
are part of the conventions associated with the condition name that
gives the proceed type its meaning.  For example, the <obj>:argument-value</obj>
proceed type for <obj>sys:wrong-type-argument</obj> errors conventionally takes
one argument, which is the new value to use.  All the values returned by
the handler are returned by <obj>signal-condition</obj> to the signaler.
</p>

<p>Here is an example of a condition handler that proceeds from
<obj>sys:wrong-type-argument</obj> errors.  It makes any atom effectively equivalent to
<obj>nil</obj> when used in <obj>car</obj> or any other function that expects a list.  The handler uses
the <obj>:description</obj> operation, which on <obj>sys:wrong-type-argument</obj> condition
instances returns a keyword describing the data type that was desired.

<lisp>(condition-bind
    ((sys:wrong-type-argument
         #'(lambda (condition)
               (if (eq (send condition :description) 'cons)
                   (values :argument-value nil)))))
<arg>  body</arg>...)

<subsection name="NIL" title="Proceeding and the Debugger"><p>If the condition invokes the debugger, then the user has the
opportunity to proceed.  When the
debugger is entered, the available proceed types are assigned
command characters starting with <obj>Super-A</obj>.  Each character becomes a
command to proceed using the corresponding proceed type.
</p>

<p>Three additional facilities are required to make it convenient for the
user to proceed using the debugger.  Each is provided by methods
defined on condition flavors.  When you define a new condition flavor,
you must provide methods to implement these facilities.

<table><tbody><tr><td><standard>Documentation:</standard></td><td>It must be possible to tell the user what each proceed type is <arg>for</arg>.

</td></tr><tr><td><standard>Not always the same proceed types:</standard></td><td>Usually the user can choose among the same set of proceed types that a

</td></tr></tbody></table></p>

<p>These three facilities are provided by methods defined on condition
flavors.  Each proceed type that is provided by signalers should be
accompanied by suitable methods.  This means that you must normally
define a new flavor if you wish to use a new proceed type.
</p>

<p>The <obj>:document-proceed-type</obj> operation is supposed to print
documentation of what a proceed type is for.  For example, when sent to
a condition instance describing an unbound variable error, if the
proceed type specified is <obj>:new-value</obj>, the text printed is something
like ``Proceed, reading a value to use instead.''
</p>
<definition><define key="condition-document-proceed-type-method" name="condition" method-name="document-proceed-type" type="method"><args>proceed-type stream</args>

<description>Prints on <arg>stream</arg> a description of the purpose of proceed type <arg>proceed-type</arg>.  This

make it convenient to define the way to document an individual proceed type.
The string printed should start with an imperative verb form, capitalized,
and end with a period.  Example:

This example is an <obj>:or</obj> method so that it can consider any proceed type.
If it returns non-<obj>nil</obj>, the system considers that it has handled the proceed type
and no other methods get a chance.  <obj>eh:places</obj> is an instance variable of
the flavor <obj>sys:failed-assertion</obj>; its values are the proceed types this method
understands.


<lisp>(defmethod (sys:failed-assertion :or :document-proceed-type)

As a last resort, if the condition instance has a <obj>:case</obj> method for
<obj>:proceed-asking-user</obj> with <arg>proceed-type</arg> as the suboperation, and this
method has a documentation string, it is printed.  This is in fact the
usual way that a proceed type is documented.
</description></definition>
<p>The <obj>:proceed-asking-user</obj> operation is supposed to ask for suitable
arguments to pass with the proceed type.  Sending <obj>:proceed-asking-user</obj>
to an instance of <obj>sys:unbound-variable</obj> with argument <obj>:new-value</obj> would
read and evaluate one expression, prompting appropriately.
</p>
<definition><define key="condition-proceed-asking-user-method" name="condition" method-name="proceed-asking-user" type="method"><args>proceed-type continuation read-object-fn</args>
</define>

<description>The method for <obj>:proceed-asking-user</obj> embodies the knowledge of how to
prompt for and read the additional arguments that go with <arg>proceed-type</arg>.

<obj>:case</obj> method combination is used (see <ref chapter="22" definition-in-file="flavor" key="method-combination" section="11" title="Method Combination" type="section"></ref>), making it
possible to define the handling of each proceed type individually in a separate
function.  The documentation string of the <obj>:case</obj> method for a proceed type is
also used as the default for <obj>:document-proceed-type</obj> on that proceed type.

The argument <arg>continuation</arg> is an internal function of the debugger which actually
proceeds from the signaled condition if the <obj>:proceed-asking-user</obj> method calls
it.  This is the only way to cause proceeding actually to happen.  Call <arg>continuation</arg> with
<obj>funcall</obj>, giving a proceed type and suitable arguments.  The proceed type passed
to <arg>continuation</arg> need not be the same as the one given to <obj>:proceed-asking-user</obj>; it should
be one of the proceed types available for handlers to use.

Alternatively, the <obj>:prompt-and-read</obj> method can return without calling <arg>continuation</arg>; then
the debugger continues to read commands.  The options which the
<obj>fs:no-more-room</obj> condition offers in the debugger, to run Dired or expunge a
directory, work this way.

The argument <arg>read-object-fn</arg> is another internal function of the debugger whose
purpose is to read arguments from the user or request confirmation.  If you wish
to do those things, you must <obj>funcall</obj> <arg>read-object-function</arg> to do it.  Use the calling
sequence documented for the function <obj>prompt-and-read</obj> (see
<ref definition-in-file="ios" key="prompt-and-read-fun" title="Function prompt-and-read" type="fun"></ref>).  (The <arg>read-object-fn</arg> may or may not actually use
<obj>prompt-and-read</obj>.)
</description></definition>
<p>Here is how <obj>sys:proceed-with-value-mixin</obj> provides for the proceed type
<obj>:new-value</obj>.  Note the documentation string, which is automatically
use by <obj>:document-proceed-type</obj> since no <obj>:case</obj> method for that operation
is provided.

<lisp>(defmethod (proceed-with-value-mixin 
                 :case :proceed-asking-user :new-value)

  (funcall continuation :new-value
           (funcall read-object-function
                    :eval-read
                    &quot;~&amp;Form whose value to use instead: &quot;)))
</lisp></p>

<p>The <obj>:user-proceed-types</obj> operation is given the list of proceed types
actually available and is supposed to return the list of proceed types to
offer to the user.  By default, this operation returns its argument: all
proceed types are available to the user through the debugger.
</p>

<p>For example, the condition name <obj>sys:unbound-variable</obj> conventionally
defines the proceed types <obj>:new-value</obj> and <obj>:no-action</obj>.  The first
specifies a new value; the second attempts to use the variable's current
value and gets another error if the variable is still unbound.  These are
clean operations for handlers to use.  But it is more convenient for the
user to be offered only one choice, which will use the variable's new
value if it is bound now, but otherwise ask for a new value.  This is
implemented with a <obj>:user-proceed-types</obj> method that replaces the two
proceed types with a single one.
</p>

<p>Or, you might wish to offer the user two different proceed types
that differ only in how they ask the user for additional information.
For handlers, there would be only one proceed type.
</p>

<p>Finally, there may be proceed types intended only for the debugger
which do not actually proceed; these should be inserted into the list
by the <obj>:user-proceed-types</obj> method.
</p>
<definition><define key="condition-user-proceed-types-method" name="condition" method-name="user-proceed-types" type="method"><args>proceed-types</args>
</define>

<description>Assuming that <arg>proceed-types</arg> is the list of proceed types available for
condition handlers to return, this operation returns the list of
proceed types that the debugger should offer to the user.

Only the proceed types offered to the user need to be handled
by <obj>:document-proceed-type</obj> and <obj>:proceed-asking-user</obj>.

The flavor <obj>condition</obj> itself defines this to return its argument.
Other condition flavors may redefine this to filter the argument
in some appropriate fashion.

<obj>:pass-on</obj> method combination is used (see <ref chapter="22" definition-in-file="flavor" key="method-combination" section="11" title="Method Combination" type="section"></ref>), so
that if multiple mixins define methods for <obj>:user-proceed-types</obj>, each method
gets a chance to add or remove proceed types.  The methods should not
actually modify the argument, but should cons up a new list in which certain
keywords are added or removed according to the other keywords that are there.

Elements should be removed only if they are specifically recognized.
This is to say, the method should make sure that any unfamiliar elements
present in the argument are also present in the value.  Arranging to omit
certain specific proceed types is legitimate; returning only
the intersection with a constant list is not legitimate.
</description></definition>
<p>Here is an example of nontrivial use of <obj>:user-proceed-types</obj>:

<lisp>(defflavor my-error () (error))

(defmethod (my-error :user-proceed-types) (proceed-types)
  (if (memq :foo proceed-types)
      (cons :foo-two-args proceed-types)
    proceed-types))

(defmethod (my-error :case :proceed-asking-user :foo) 
               (cont read-object-fn)
  &quot;Proceeds, reading a value to foo with.&quot;
  (funcall cont :foo
           (funcall read-object-fn :eval-read
                    &quot;Value to foo with: &quot;)))

(defmethod (my-error :case :proceed-asking-user :foo-two-args)
               (cont read-object-fn)
  &quot;Proceeds, reading two values to foo with.&quot;
  (funcall cont :foo
           (funcall read-object-fn :eval-read
                    &quot;Value to foo with: &quot;)
           (funcall read-object-fn :eval-read
                    &quot;Value to foo some more with: &quot;)))
</lisp></p>

<p>In this example, if the signaler provides the proceed type <obj>:foo</obj>, then it is
described for the user as ``proceeds, reading a value to foo with''; and if
the user specifies that proceed type, he is asked for a single value,
which is used as the argument when proceeding.  In addition, the
user is offered the proceed type <obj>:foo-two-args</obj>, which has its own
documentation and which reads two values.  But for condition handlers
there is really only one proceed type, <obj>:foo</obj>.  <obj>:foo-two-args</obj> is just an
alternate interface for the user to proceed type <obj>:foo</obj>, and this is why the
<obj>:user-proceed-types</obj> method offers <obj>:foo-two-args</obj> only if the signaler
is willing to accept <obj>:foo</obj>.
</p>
</subsection>


<subsection name="NIL" title="How Signalers Provide Proceed Types"><p>Each condition name defines a conceptual meaning for certain
proceed types, but this does not mean that all of those proceed types
may be used every time the condition is signaled.  The signaler must
specifically implement the proceed types in order to make them do what
they are conventionally supposed to do.  For some signalers it may be
difficult to do, or may not even make sense.  For example, it is no use
having a proceed type <obj>:store-new-value</obj> if the signaler does not have a
suitable place to store, permanently, the argument the handler supplies.
</p>

<p>Therefore, we require each signaler to specify just which proceed types
it implements.  Unless the signaler explicitly specifies proceed types
one way or another, no proceed types are allowed (except for nonlocal ones,
described in the following section).
</p>

<p>One way to specify the proceed types allowed is to call <obj>signal-condition</obj> and
pass the list of proceed types as the second argument.
</p>

<p>Another way that is less general but more convenient is
<obj>signal-proceed-case</obj>.

<p>When the caller of <obj>signal-condition</obj> specifies proceed types, these are called
<arg>local proceed types</arg>.  They are implemented at the point of signaling.  There are
also <arg>nonlocal proceed types</arg>, which are in effect for all conditions (with appropriate
condition names) signaled during the execution of the body of the establishing
macro.  We say that the macro establishes a <arg>resume handler</arg> for the proceed type.
</p>

<p>The most general construct for establishing a resume handler is <obj>condition-resume</obj>.
For example, in

<lisp>(condition-resume
    '(fs:file-error :retry-open t
                    (&quot;Proceeds, opening the file again.&quot;)
                    (lambda (ignore) (throw 'tag nil)))
  (do-forever
    (catch 'tag (return (open pathname)))))
</lisp>the proceed type <obj>:retry-open</obj> is available for all <obj>fs:file-error</obj> conditions signaled
within the call to <obj>open</obj>.

<description>Both execute <arg>body</arg> with a resume handler in effect for a nonlocal proceed type according to
the value of <arg>handler-form</arg>.  For <obj>condition-resume-if</obj>, the resume handler is in
effect only if <arg>cond-form</arg>'s value is non-<obj>nil</obj>.

<arg>condition-names</arg> is a condition name or a list of them.  The resume handler
applies to these conditions only.

<arg>proceed-type</arg> is the proceed type implemented by this resume handler.

<arg>predicate</arg> is either <obj>t</obj> or a function that is applied to a condition instance and
determines whether the resume handler is in effect for that condition instance.

<arg>format-string-and-args</arg> is a list of a string and additional arguments that can be
passed to <obj>format</obj> to print a description of what this proceed type is for.
These are needed only for anonymous proceed types.

<arg>handler-function</arg> is the function called to do the work of proceeding, once this
proceed type has been returned by a condition handler or the debugger.

<description>Executes <arg>body</arg> with (if <arg>cond-form</arg> produces a non-<obj>nil</obj> value) a resume handler for
proceed type <arg>proceed-type</arg> and condition(s) <arg>condition-names</arg>.  <arg>condition-names</arg>
should be a symbol or a list of symbols; it is not evaluated.  <arg>proceed-type</arg> should be
a symbol.

If proceeding is done using this resume handler, control returns from the
<obj>catch-error-restart-explicit-if</obj> form.  The first value is <obj>nil</obj> and the second is
non-<obj>nil</obj>.

<arg>format-string</arg> and the <arg>format-args</arg>, all of which are evaluated, are used by the
<obj>:document-proceed-type</obj> operation to describe the proceed type, if it is
anonymous.
</description></definition>
<p>For condition handlers there is no distinction between local and nonlocal
proceed types.  They are both included in the list of available proceed types
returned by the <obj>:proceed-types</obj> operation (all the local proceed types come
first), and the condition handler selects one by returning the proceed type and
any conventionally associated arguments.  The debugger's <obj>:user-proceed-types</obj>,
<obj>:document-proceed-type</obj> and <obj>:proceed-asking-user</obj> operations are also make
no distinction.
</p>

<p>The difference comes after the handler or the debugger returns
to <obj>signal-condition</obj>.  If the proceed type is a local one (one of those in the
second argument to <obj>signal-condition</obj>), <obj>signal-condition</obj> simply returns.
If the proceed type is not among those the caller handles, <obj>signal-condition</obj> looks for
a resume handler
associated with the proceed type, and calls its handler function.  The arguments to the handler
function are the condition instance, the <arg>additional-args</arg> specified in the resume
handler, and any arguments returned by the condition handler in addition to
the proceed type.  The handler function is supposed to do a throw.  If it returns
to <obj>signal-condition</obj>, an error is signaled.
</p>

<p>You are allowed to use ``anonymous'' nonlocal proceed types, which have no
conventional meaning and are not specially known to the
<obj>:document-proceed-type</obj> and <obj>:proceed-asking-user</obj> operations.  The anonymous
proceed type may be any Lisp object.  The default definition of
<obj>:proceed-asking-user</obj> handles an anonymous proceed type by simply calling the
continuation passed to it, reading no arguments.  The default definition of
<obj>:document-proceed-type</obj> handles anonymous proceed types by passing <obj>format</obj>
the <arg>format-string-and-args</arg> list found in the resume handler (this is what that list
is for).
</p>

<p>Anonymous proceed types are often lists.  Such proceed types are usually made by some variant
of <obj>error-restart</obj>, and they are treated a little bit specially.  For one
thing, they are all put at the end of the list returned by the <obj>:proceed-types</obj>
operation.  For another, the debugger command <obj>Control-C</obj> or <obj>Resume</obj> never uses
a proceed type which is a list.  If no atomic proceed type is available, <obj>Resume</obj> or
<obj>Control-C</obj> is not allowed.

<description>All execute body with an anonymous resume handler for <arg>condition-names</arg>.
The proceed type for this resume handler is a list, so the <obj>Resume</obj> key will not use it.
<arg>condition-names</arg> is either a single condition name or a list of them, or <obj>nil</obj>
meaning all conditions; it is not evaluated.

<arg>format-string</arg> and the <arg>format-args</arg>, all of which are evaluated, are used by the
<obj>:document-proceed-type</obj> operation to describe the anonymous proceed type.

If the resume handler made by <obj>error-restart</obj> is invoked by proceeding from a
signal, the automatically generated resume handler function does a throw back to
the <obj>error-restart</obj> and the body is executed again from the beginning.  If body
returns, the values of the last form in it are returned from the <obj>error-restart</obj>
form.

<obj>error-restart-loop</obj> is like <obj>error-restart</obj> except that it loops to the beginning of
body even if body completes normally.  It is like enclosing an <obj>error-restart</obj> in an
iteration.

<obj>catch-error-restart</obj> is like <obj>error-restart</obj> except that it never loops back to the
beginning.  If the anonymous proceed type is used for proceeding, the
<obj>catch-error-restart</obj> form returns with <obj>nil</obj> as the first value and a non-<obj>nil</obj> second
value.

<obj>catch-error-restart-if</obj> is like <obj>catch-error-restart</obj> except that the resume
handler is only in effect if the value of the <arg>cond-form</arg> is non-<obj>nil</obj>.

All of these variants of <obj>error-restart</obj> can be written in terms of
<obj>condition-resume-if</obj>.
</description></definition>
<p>These forms are typically used by any sort of command loop, so that aborting
within the command loop returns to it and reads another command.
<obj>error-restart-loop</obj> is often right for simple command loops.  <obj>catch-error-restart</obj>
is useful when aborting should terminate execution rather than retry, or with an
explicit conditional to test whether a throw was done.
</p>

<p><obj>error-restart</obj> forms often specify <obj>(error sys:abort)</obj> as the <arg>condition-names</arg>.
The presence of <obj>error</obj> causes them to be listed (and assigned command
characters) by the debugger, for all errors, and the presence of <obj>sys:abort</obj> causes
the <obj>Abort</obj> key to use them.  If you would like a procede type to be offered as an option
by the debugger, but do not want the <obj>Abort</obj> key to use it, specify just <obj>error</obj>.

</define>

<description>Invokes the innermost applicable resume handler for <arg>proceed-type</arg>.
Applicability of a resume handler is determined by matching its condition names
against those possessed by <arg>condition-instance</arg> and by applying its predicate, if not
<obj>t</obj>, to <arg>condition-instance</arg>.

If <arg>proceed-type</arg> is <obj>nil</obj>, the innermost applicable resume handler is invoked
regardless of its proceed type.  However, in this case, the scan stops if <obj>t</obj> is
encountered as an element of <obj>eh:condition-resume-handlers</obj>.
</description></definition><definition>
<define key="eh:condition-resume-handlers-var" name="eh:condition-resume-handlers" type="var"></define>

<description>The current list of resume handlers for nonlocal proceed types.
<obj>condition-resume</obj> works by binding this variable.  Elements are usually lists
that have the format described above under <obj>condition-resume</obj>.  The symbol <obj>t</obj>
is also meaningful as an element of this list.  It terminates the scan for a resume
handler when it is made by <obj>signal-condition</obj> for a condition that was not
handled.  <obj>t</obj> is pushed onto the list by break loops and the debugger to shield the
evaluation of your type-in from automatic invocation of resume handlers
established outside the break loop or the error.

The links of this list, and its elements, are often created using <obj>with-stack-list</obj>.
so be careful if you try to save the value outside the context in which you
examine it.
</description></definition><definition><define key="sys:abort-condition" name="sys:abort" type="condition"><args>(<obj>condition</obj>)</args>
</define>

<description>This condition is signaled by the <obj>Abort</obj> key; it is how that key is implemented.
Most command loops use some version of <obj>error-restart</obj> to set up a resume
handler for <obj>sys:abort</obj> so that it will return to the innermost command loop if (as
is usually the case) no handler handles it.  These resume handlers usually apply
to <obj>error</obj> as well as <obj>sys:abort</obj>, so that the debugger will offer a specific command
to return to the command loop even if it is not the innermost one.
