<index-entry index="concepts" title="multiprocessing"></index-entry>

<index-entry index="concepts" title="wait"></index-entry>

<p>The Lisp Machine supports <arg>multi-processing</arg>;  several computations
can be executed concurrently by placing each in a separate
<arg>process</arg>.  A process is like a processor, simulated by software.
Each process has its own program counter, its own stack of function
calls and its own special-variable binding environment in which to
execute its computation.  (This is implemented with stack groups; see
<ref chapter="14" definition-in-file="fd-sg" key="stack-group" section="0" title="Stack Groups" type="section"></ref>.)
</p>

<p>If all the processes are simply trying to compute, the machine allows
them all to run an equal share of the time.  This is not a particularly
efficient mode of operation since dividing the finite memory and
processor power of the machine among several processes certainly cannot
increase the available power and in fact wastes some of it in overhead.
The typical use for processes is that at any time only one or two
are trying to run.  The rest are either <arg>waiting</arg> for some event to
occur or <arg>stopped</arg> and not allowed to compete for resources.
</p>

<index-entry index="concepts" title="process wait function"></index-entry>

<p>A process waits for an event by means of the <obj>process-wait</obj> primitive,
which is given a predicate function which defines the event being waited
for.  A module of the system called the process scheduler periodically
calls that function.  If it returns <obj>nil</obj> the process continues to wait;
if it returns <obj>t</obj> the process is made runnable and its call to
<obj>process-wait</obj> returns, allowing the computation to proceed.
</p>

<index-entry index="concepts" title="run reason"></index-entry>

<index-entry index="concepts" title="arrest reason"></index-entry>

<index-entry index="concepts" title="active process"></index-entry>

<p>A process may be <arg>active</arg> or <arg>stopped</arg>.  Stopped processes are
never allowed to run; they are not considered by the scheduler, and so
can never become the current process until they are made active again.
The scheduler continually tests the waiting functions of all the active
processes, and those which return non-<obj>nil</obj> values are allowed to run.
When you first create a process with <obj>make-process</obj>, it is inactive.
</p>

<p>The activity of a process is controlled by two sets of Lisp objects
associated with it, called its <arg>run reasons</arg> and its <arg>arrest
reasons</arg>.  These sets are implemented as lists.  Any kind of object
can be in these sets; typically keyword symbols and active objects
such as windows and other processes are found.  A process is
considered active when it has at least one run reason and no
arrest reasons.
</p>

<p>To get a computation to happen in another process, you must first create
a process, then say what computation you want to happen in that
process.  The computation to be executed by a process is specified as an
<arg>initial function</arg> and a list of arguments to that
function.  When the process starts up it applies the function to the
arguments.  In some cases the initial function is written so that it
never returns, while in other cases it performs a certain computation
and then returns, which stops the process.
</p>

<p>To <arg>reset</arg> a process means to exit its entire computation nonlocally
using <obj>*unwind-stack</obj> (see <ref definition-in-file="fd-flo" key="*unwind-stack-fun" title="Function *unwind-stack" type="fun"></ref>).  Some processes are
temporary and die when reset.  The other, permanent functions start
their computations over again when reset.  Resetting a process clears
its waiting condition, so that if it is active it becomes runnable.  To
<arg>preset</arg> a function is to set up its initial function (and arguments)
and then reset it.  This is how you start up a computation in a process.
</p>

<p>All processes in a Lisp Machine run in the same virtual address space,
sharing the same set of Lisp objects.  Unlike other systems that have
special restricted mechanisms for inter-process communication, the
Lisp Machine allows processes to communicate in arbitrary ways through
shared Lisp objects.  One process can inform another of an event simply
by changing the value of a global variable.  Buffers containing messages
from one process to another can be implemented as lists or arrays.
The usual mechanisms of atomic operations, critical sections, and
interlocks are provided
(see <obj>store-conditional</obj> [<ref definition-in-file="proces" key="store-conditional-fun" title="Function store-conditional" type="fun"></ref>],
<obj>without-interrupts</obj> [<ref definition-in-file="proces" key="without-interrupts-fun" title="Macro without-interrupts" type="mac"></ref>],
and <obj>process-lock</obj> [<ref definition-in-file="proces" key="process-lock-fun" title="Function process-lock" type="fun"></ref>]).
</p>

<p>A process is a Lisp object, an instance of one of several flavors
of process (see <ref chapter="22" definition-in-file="flavor" key="flavor" section="0" title="Objects, Message Passing, and Flavors" type="section"></ref>).  The remainder of this chapter describes
the operations defined on processes, the functions you can apply to
a process, and the functions and variables a program running in a process
can use to manipulate its process.
</p>
<a name="scheduler"></a>


<section chapter-number="30" name="scheduler" number="1" title="The Scheduler"><index-entry index="concepts" title="scheduler"></index-entry>

<p indent="1">        At any time there is a set of <arg>active processes</arg>; as described
above, these are all the processes that are not stopped.  Each active
process is either currently running, runnable (ready to run), or waiting for some
condition to become true.  The active processes are managed by a special
stack group called the <arg>scheduler</arg>, which repeatedly examines each active
process to determine whether it is waiting or ready to run.  The scheduler
then selects one process and starts it up.
</p>

<p>The process chosen by the scheduler becomes the <arg>current process</arg>,
that is, the one process that is running on the machine.  The scheduler
sets the variable <obj>current-process</obj> to it.  It remains the current
process and continues to run until either it decides to wait, or a
<arg>sequence break</arg> occurs.  In either case, the scheduler stack group is
resumed.  It then updates the process's run time meters and chooses a
new process to run next.  This way, each process that is ready to run
gets its share of time in which to execute.
</p>

<index-entry index="concepts" title="priority (of a process)"></index-entry>

<p>Each process has a <arg>priority</arg> which is a number.  Most processes
have priority zero.  Larger numbers give a process more priority.
The scheduler only considers the highest priority runnable processes,
so if there is one runnable process with priority 20 then no process
with lesser priority can run.
</p>

<index-entry index="concepts" title="wait function"></index-entry>

<p>The scheduler determines whether a process is runnable by applying the
process's <arg>wait-function</arg> to its <arg>wait-argument-list</arg>.  If the
wait-function returns a non-<obj>nil</obj> value, then the process is ready to
run; otherwise, it is waiting.
</p>

<p>A process can wait for some condition to become true by calling
<obj>process-wait</obj> (see <ref definition-in-file="proces" key="process-wait-fun" title="Function process-wait" type="fun"></ref>).  This function sets the
process's wait-function and wait-argument-list as specified by the
caller, and resumes the scheduler stack group.  A process can also wait
for just a moment by calling <obj>process-allow-schedule</obj> (see
<ref definition-in-file="proces" key="process-allow-schedule-fun" title="Function process-allow-schedule" type="fun"></ref>), which resumes the scheduler stack group
but leaves the process runnable; it will run again as soon as all other
runnable processes have had a chance.
</p>

<p>A sequence break is a kind of interrupt that is generated by the Lisp
system for any of a variety of reasons; when it occurs, the scheduler is
resumed.  The function <obj>si:sb-on</obj> (see <ref definition-in-file="proces" key="si:sb-on-fun" title="Function si:sb-on" type="fun"></ref>) can be used to
control when sequence breaks occur.  The default is to sequence break
once a second.  Thus even if a process never waits and is not stopped,
it is forced to return control to the scheduler once a second so that
any other runnable processes can get their turn.
</p>

<p>The system does not generate a sequence break when a page fault occurs;
thus time spent waiting for a page to come in from the disk is ``charged''
to a process the same as time spent computing, and cannot be used by
other processes.  It is done this way for the sake of simplicity; this
allows the whole implementation of the process system to reside in
ordinary virtual memory, so that it does not have to worry specially
about paging.  The performance penalty is small since Lisp Machines are
personal computers, not multiplexed among a large number of processes.
Usually only one process at a time is runnable.
</p>

<p>A process's wait function is free to touch any data structure it likes
and to perform any computation it likes.  Of course, wait functions
should be kept simple, using only a small amount of time and touching
only a small number of pages, or system performance will be impacted
since the wait function will consume resources even when its process is
not running.
</p>

<p>If a wait function gets an error, the error occurs inside the scheduler.
If this enters the debugger, all scheduling comes to a halt until the
user proceeds or aborts.  Aborting in the debugger inside the scheduler
``blasts'' the current process by giving it a trivial wait function that
always returns <obj>nil</obj>; this prevents recurrence of the same problem.
It is best to write wait functions that cannot get errors, by keeping
them simple and by arranging for any problems to be detected before the
scheduler sees the wait function.  <obj>process-wait</obj> calls the wait
function once before giving it to the scheduler, and this often exposes
an error before it can interfere with scheduling.
</p>

<p>Note well that a process's wait function is executed inside the
scheduler stack-group, <arg>not</arg> inside the process.  This means that a
wait function may not access special variables bound in the process.  It
is allowed to access global variables.  It can access variables bound by
a process through the closure mechanism (<ref chapter="13" definition-in-file="fd-clo" key="closure" section="0" title="Closures" type="section"></ref>).  If the wait
function is defined lexically within the caller of <obj>process-wait</obj> then
it can access local variables through the lexical scoping mechanism.
Most commonly any values needed by the wait function are passed to it as
arguments.
</p>
<definition>
<define key="current-process-var" name="current-process" type="var"></define>

<description>The value of <obj>current-process</obj> is the process that is currently
executing, or <obj>nil</obj> while the scheduler is running.  When the
scheduler calls a process's wait-function, it binds <obj>current-process</obj>
to the process so that the wait-function can access its process.
</description></definition><definition><define key="without-interrupts-fun" name="without-interrupts" type="mac"><args>body...</args>
</define>

<description>The <arg>body</arg> forms are evaluated with
<obj>inhibit-scheduling-flag</obj> bound to <obj>t</obj>.  This is the recommended
way to lock out multi-processing over a small critical section of code
to prevent timing errors.  In other words the body is an
<arg>atomic operation</arg>.  The values of the last form in the body
are ultimately returned.

In this example, <obj>list</obj> is presumed to be a global variable
referred to from two places in the code which different
processes will execute.

<description>The value of <obj>inhibit-scheduling-flag</obj> is normally <obj>nil</obj>.
<obj>without-interrupts</obj> binds it to <obj>t</obj>, which prevents
process-switching until <obj>inhibit-scheduling-flag</obj> becomes <obj>nil</obj>

directly to this variable.
</description></definition><definition><define key="process-wait-fun" name="process-wait" type="fun"><args>whostate function <standard>&amp;rest</standard> arguments</args>

<description>This is the primitive for waiting.  The current process waits until the
application of <arg>function</arg> to <arg>arguments</arg> returns non-<obj>nil</obj>
(at which time <obj>process-wait</obj> returns).  Note that <arg>function</arg> is applied
in the environment of the scheduler, not the environment of the <obj>process-wait</obj>,
so special bindings in effect when <obj>process-wait</obj> was called are <arg>not</arg> be
in effect when <arg>function</arg> is applied.  Be careful when using any free
references in <arg>function</arg>.  <arg>whostate</arg> is a string containing a brief
description of the reason for waiting.  If the who-line at the bottom
of the screen is looking at this process, it will show <arg>whostate</arg>.

<description>This is like <obj>process-wait</obj> except that if <arg>interval</arg> sixtieths of a

still returning <obj>nil</obj>, then <obj>process-wait-with-timeout</obj> returns
anyway.  The value returned is the value of applying <arg>function</arg> to
<arg>arguments</arg>; thus, it is non-<obj>nil</obj> if the wait condition actually
occurred, <obj>nil</obj> for a time-out.

If <arg>interval</arg> is <obj>nil</obj>, there is no timeout, and this function is then
equivalent to <obj>process-wait</obj>.
</description></definition><definition><define key="with-timeout-fun" name="with-timeout" type="mac"><args>(interval timeout-forms...) body...</args>

<description><arg>body</arg> is executed with a timeout in effect for <arg>interval</arg> sixtieths of a second.  If

values of the last form in <arg>body</arg> are returned.

If after <arg>interval</arg> has elapsed <arg>body</arg> has not completed, its

<define key="sys:clock-function-list-var" name="sys:clock-function-list" type="var"></define>

<description>This is a list of functions to be called by the scheduler 60 times a second.
Each function is passed one argument, the number of 60ths of a second
since the last time that the functions on this list were called.
These functions implement various
system overhead operations such as blinking the blinking cursor
on the screen.  Note that these functions are called inside the
scheduler, just as are the functions of simple processes (see <ref definition-in-file="proces" key="simple-process" type="page"></ref>).
The scheduler calls these functions as often as possible, but never
more often than 60 times a second.  That is, if there are no processes
ready to run, the scheduler calls the clock functions 60 times a second,
assuming that, all together, they take less than 1/60 second to run.
If there are processes continually ready to run, then the scheduler calls
the clock functions as often as it can; usually this is once a second, since
usually the scheduler gets control only once a second.

<description>Controls what events cause a sequence break, i.e. when

which can cause a sequence break.

is one second.  See <obj>sys:%tv-clock-rate</obj>, <ref definition-in-file="fd-sub" key="sys:%tv-clock-rate-meter" title="Meter sys:%tv-clock-rate" type="meter"></ref>.
</td></tr><tr><td><obj>:keyboard</obj></td><td>Happens when a character is received from the keyboard.
</td></tr><tr><td><obj>:chaos</obj></td><td>Happens when a packet is received from the Chaosnet,
or transmission of a packet to the Chaosnet is completed.
</td></tr></tbody></table>
Since the keyboard and Chaosnet are heavily buffered, there is no
particular advantage to enabling the <obj>:keyboard</obj> and <obj>:chaos</obj> events,
unless the <obj>:clock</obj> event is disabled.

With no argument, <obj>si:sb-on</obj> returns a list
of keywords for the currently enabled events.

With an argument, the set of enabled events is changed.  The argument
can be a keyword, a list of keywords, <obj>nil</obj> (which disables sequence
breaks entirely since it is the empty list), or a number, which is the
internal mask, not documented here.
</description></definition></section><a name="Locks"></a>


<section chapter-number="30" name="Locks" number="2" title="Locks"><index-entry index="concepts" title="lock"></index-entry>

<p indent="1">        A <arg>lock</arg> is a software construct used for synchronization
of two processes.  A lock is either held by some process, or is free.
When a process tries to seize a lock, it waits until the lock is free,
and then it becomes the process holding the lock.  When it is finished,
it unlocks the lock, allowing some other process to seize it.
A lock protects some resource or data structure so that only one
process at a time can use it.
</p>

<p indent="1">        In the Lisp Machine, a lock is a locative pointer to a cell.
If the lock is free, the cell contains <obj>nil</obj>; otherwise it contains
the process that holds the lock.  The <obj>process-lock</obj> and <obj>process-unlock</obj>
functions are written in such a way as to guarantee that two processes
can never both think that they hold a certain lock; only one process
can ever hold a lock at one time.
</p>
<definition><define key="process-lock-fun" name="process-lock" type="fun"><args>locative <standard>&amp;optional</standard> (lock-value <obj>current-process</obj>) (whostate <obj>&quot;Lock&quot;</obj>) timeout</args>
</define>

<description>This is used to seize the lock that <arg>locative</arg> points to.
If necessary, <obj>process-lock</obj> waits until the lock becomes free.
When <obj>process-lock</obj> returns, the lock has been seized.  <arg>lock-value</arg>
is the object to store into the cell specified by <arg>locative</arg>, and
<arg>whostate</arg> is passed on to <obj>process-wait</obj>.

If <arg>timeout</arg> is non-<obj>nil</obj>, it should be a fixnum representing a time
interval in 60ths of a second.  If it is necessary to wait more than that long,
an error with condition name <obj>sys:lock-timeout</obj> is signaled.
</description></definition><definition><define key="process-unlock-fun" name="process-unlock" type="fun"><args>locative <standard>&amp;optional</standard> (lock-value <obj>current-process</obj>)</args>
</define>

<description>This is used to unlock the lock that <arg>locative</arg> points to.
If the lock is free or was locked by some other process, an
error is signaled.  Otherwise the lock is unlocked.  <arg>lock-value</arg>
must have the same value as the <arg>lock-value</arg> parameter to the matching
call to <obj>process-lock</obj>, or else an error is signaled.
</description></definition><definition><define key="sys:lock-timeout-condition" name="sys:lock-timeout" type="condition"><args>(<obj>error</obj>)</args>
</define>

<description>This condition is signaled when <obj>process-lock</obj> waits longer than the
specified timeout.
</description></definition>
<p indent="1">        It is a good idea to use <obj>unwind-protect</obj> to make sure that
you unlock any lock that you seize.  For example, if you write

<lisp>(unwind-protect
   (progn (process-lock lock-3)
          (function-1)
          (function-2))
   (process-unlock lock-3))
</lisp>then even if <obj>function-1</obj> or <obj>function-2</obj> does a <obj>throw</obj>,
<obj>lock-3</obj> will get unlocked correctly.  Particular programs that use
locks often define special forms that package this <obj>unwind-protect</obj>
up into a convenient stylistic device.
</p>

<p>A higher level locking construct is <obj>with-lock</obj>:
</p>
<definition><define key="with-lock-fun" name="with-lock" type="mac"><args>(lock <standard>&amp;key</standard> norecursive) body...</args>
</define>

<description>Executes the <arg>body</arg> with <arg>lock</arg> locked.
<arg>lock</arg> should actually be an expression whose value would be the
status of the lock; it is used inside <obj>locf</obj> to get a locative
pointer with which the locking and unlocking are done.

It is OK for one process to lock a lock multiple times, recursively,
using <obj>with-lock</obj>, provided <arg>norecursive</arg> is not <obj>nil</obj>.

<arg>norecursive</arg> should be literally <obj>t</obj> or <obj>nil</obj>; it is not
evaluated.  If it is <obj>t</obj>, this call to <obj>with-lock</obj> signals
an error if the lock is already locked by the running process.
</description></definition>
<p>A lower level construct which can be used to implement atomic
operations, and is used in the implementation of <obj>process-lock</obj>,
is <obj>store-conditional</obj>.
</p>
<definition><define key="store-conditional-fun" name="store-conditional" type="fun"><args>location oldvalue newvalue</args>
</define>

<description>This stores <arg>newvalue</arg> into <arg>location</arg> iff <arg>location</arg> currently
contains <arg>oldvalue</arg>.  The value is <obj>t</obj> iff the cell was changed.

If <arg>location</arg> is a list, the cdr of the list is tested and stored
in.  This is in accord with the general principle of how to access the
contents of a locative properly, and makes 
<obj>(store-conditional (locf (cdr x)) ...)</obj> work.
</description></definition>
<p>An even lower-level construct is the subprimitive
<obj>%store-conditional</obj>, which is like <obj>store-conditional</obj> with no
error checking, but is faster.

<subsection name="NIL" title="Process Queues"><p>A process queue is a kind of lock which can record several processes
which are waiting for the lock and grant them the lock in the order that
they requested it.  The queue has a fixed size.  If the number of

lock in the order of requests.  If too many processes are waiting then
the order of requesting is not remembered for the extra ones, but proper
interlocking is still maintained.

<p>The following functions allow you to call a function and have its
execution happen asynchronously in another process.  This can be used
either as a simple way to start up a process that will run ``forever'', or
as a way to make something happen without having to wait for it
to complete.  When the function returns, the process is returned to a pool
of free processes for reuse.  The only difference between these three
functions is in what happens if the machine is booted while the process
is still active.
</p>

<p>Normally the function to be run should not do any I/O to the terminal,
as it does not have a window and terminal I/O will cause it to make a
notification and wait for user attention.  Refer to
<ref chapter="14" definition-in-file="fd-sg" key="sg-terminal-io-issues" section="5" title="Input/Output in Stack Groups" type="section"></ref> for a discussion of the issues.

<description>Creates a process, presets it to apply
<arg>function</arg> to <arg>args</arg>, and starts it running.
The value returned is the new process.
The process is killed if <arg>function</arg> returns; by default,
it is also killed if it is reset.
Example:

<lisp>(defun background-print (file)
  (process-run-function &quot;Print&quot; 'hardcopy-file file))
</lisp>creates a background process that prints the specified file.

<arg>name-or-options</arg> can be either a string specifying a name for
the process or a list of alternating keywords and values that can
specify the name and various other parameters.

<table><tbody><tr><td><obj>:name</obj></td><td>This keyword should be followed by a string which specifies the name
of the process.  The default is <obj>&quot;Anonymous&quot;</obj>.
</td></tr><tr><td><obj>:restart-after-reset</obj></td><td>This keyword says what to do to the process if it is reset.  <obj>nil</obj>

<subsection name="NIL" title="Process Attributes"><definition>
<define key="si:process-name-method" name="si:process" method-name="name" type="method"></define>

<description>Returns the name of the process, which was the first argument to <obj>make-process</obj>
or <obj>process-run-function</obj> when the process was created.  The name is
a string that appears in the printed-representation of the process, stands for
the process in the who-line and the <obj>peek</obj> display, etc.
</description></definition><definition>
<define key="si:process-stack-group-method" name="si:process" method-name="stack-group" type="method"></define>

<description>Returns the stack group currently executing on behalf of this process.
This can be different from the initial-stack-group if the process contains
several stack groups that coroutine among themselves,
or if the process is in the error-handler, which runs in its own stack group.

Note that the stack-group of a <arg>simple</arg> process (see <ref definition-in-file="proces" key="simple-process" type="page"></ref>)
is not a stack group at all, but a function.
</description></definition><definition>
<define key="si:process-initial-stack-group-method" name="si:process" method-name="initial-stack-group" type="method"></define>

<description>Returns the stack group the initial-function is called in when the process starts up
or is reset.
</description></definition><definition>
<define key="si:process-initial-form-method" name="si:process" method-name="initial-form" type="method"></define>

<description>Returns the initial ``form'' of the process.
This isn't really a Lisp form; it is a cons whose car is the initial-function
and whose cdr is the list of arguments to which that function is applied
when the process starts up or is reset.

In a simple process (see <ref definition-in-file="proces" key="simple-process" type="page"></ref>), the initial form is a list of one
element, the process's function.

To change the initial form, use the <obj>:preset</obj> operation (see <ref definition-in-file="proces" key="si:process-preset-method" title="Method si:process :preset" type="method"></ref>).
</description></definition><definition>
<define key="si:process-wait-function-method" name="si:process" method-name="wait-function" type="method"></define>

<description>Returns the process's current wait-function, which is the predicate used
by the scheduler to determine if the process is runnable.  This is
<obj>#'true</obj> if the process is running, and <obj>#'false</obj> if the process has
no current computation (for instance, if it has just been created, its
initial function has returned) or if the program has decided to wait
indefinitely.  The wait-function of a flushed process is <obj>si:flushed-process</obj>,
a function equivalent to <obj>#'false</obj> but recognizably distinct.
</description></definition><definition>
<define key="si:process-wait-argument-list-method" name="si:process" method-name="wait-argument-list" type="method"></define>

<description>Returns the arguments to the process's current wait-function.  This is
frequently the <obj>&amp;rest</obj> argument to <obj>process-wait</obj> in the
process's stack.  The system always uses it in
a safe manner, i.e. it forgets about it before <obj>process-wait</obj> returns.
</description></definition><definition>
<define key="si:process-whostate-method" name="si:process" method-name="whostate" type="method"></define>

<description>Returns a string that is the state of the process to go in the who-line at
the bottom of the screen.  This is <obj>&quot;run&quot;</obj> if the process is running or
trying to run; otherwise, it is the reason why the process is waiting.  If the
process is stopped, then this whostate string is ignored and the who-line
displays <obj>arrest</obj> if the process is arrested or <obj>stop</obj> if the process has
no run reasons.

<description>Respectively return and change the priority of this process.  The larger the number, the
more this process gets to run.  Within a priority level the scheduler runs all
runnable processes in a round-robin fashion.  Regardless of priority a process
will not run for more than its quantum.  The default priority is 0, and no
normal process uses other than 0.

<description>Respectively return and change the process's warm-boot-action, which controls what
happens if the machine is booted while this process is active.
(Contrary to the name, this applies to both cold and warm booting.) This
can be <obj>nil</obj> or <obj>:flush</obj>, which means to <arg>flush</arg> the process (see
<ref definition-in-file="proces" key="flushed-process" type="page"></ref>), or can be a function to call.  The default is
<obj>si:process-warm-boot-delayed-restart</obj>, which resets the process,
causing it to start over at its initial function.  You can also use
<obj>si:process-warm-boot-reset</obj>, which throws out of the process'
computation and kills the process, or <obj>si:process-warm-boot-restart</obj>,
which is like the default but restarts the process at an earlier stage
of system reinitialization.  This is used for processes like the
keyboard process and chaos background process, which are needed for
reinitialization itself.

<subsection name="NIL" title="Bashing the Process"><definition><define key="si:process-preset-method" name="si:process" method-name="preset" type="method"><args>function <standard>&amp;rest</standard> args</args>

<description>Sets the process's initial function to <arg>function</arg> and initial arguments
to <arg>args</arg>.  The process is then reset so that any computation occuring in it
is terminated and it begins anew by applying <arg>function</arg> to <arg>args</arg>.
A <obj>:preset</obj> operation on a stopped process
returns immediately, but does not activate the process; hence the

</description></definition><definition><define key="si:process-reset-method" name="si:process" method-name="reset" type="method"><args><standard>&amp;optional</standard> no-unwind kill</args>

<description>Forces the process to throw out of its present computation and apply its
initial function to its initial arguments, when it next runs.  The
throwing out is skipped if the process has no present computation (e.g.
it was just created), or if the <arg>no-unwind</arg> option so specifies.  The
possible values for <arg>no-unwind</arg> are:

<table><tbody><tr><td><obj>:unless-current</obj></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><obj>nil</obj></td><td>Unwind unless the stack group to be unwound is the one currently
executing, or belongs to the current process.

caller instead of returning.

</td></tr><tr><td><obj>t</obj></td><td>Never unwind.
</td></tr></tbody></table>
If <arg>kill</arg> is <obj>t</obj>, the process is to be killed after unwinding it.
This is for internal use by the <obj>:kill</obj> operation only.

A <obj>:reset</obj> operation on a stopped process returns immediately, but
does not activate the process; hence the process will not really get
reset until it is activated later.

<define key="si:process-flush-method" name="si:process" method-name="flush" type="method"></define>

<description>Forces the process to wait forever.  A process may not <obj>:flush</obj> itself.
Flushing a process is different from stopping it, in that it is still active
and hence if it is reset or preset it will start running again.

A flushed process can be recognized because its wait-function is
<obj>si:flushed-process</obj>.
If a process belonging to a window is flushed, exposing or selecting the window
resets the process.
</description></definition><definition>
<define key="si:process-kill-method" name="si:process" method-name="kill" type="method"></define>

</description></definition><definition><define key="si:process-interrupt-method" name="si:process" method-name="interrupt" type="method"><args>function <standard>&amp;rest</standard> args</args>
</define>

<description>Forces the process to <obj>apply</obj> <arg>function</arg> to <arg>args</arg>.  When <arg>function</arg> returns,
the process continues the interrupted computation.  If the process is waiting,
it wakes up, calls <arg>function</arg>, then waits again when <arg>function</arg> returns.

If the process is stopped it does not <obj>apply</obj> <arg>function</arg> to <arg>args</arg> 
immediately, but will later when it is activated.  Normally the <obj>:interrupt</obj> operation
returns immediately, but if the process's stack group is in an unusual internal
state <obj>:interrupt</obj> may have to wait for it to get out of that state.

<description><index-entry index="concepts" title="simple process"></index-entry>
A simple process is not a process in the conventional sense.  It has no
stack group of its own; instead of having a stack group that gets
resumed when it is time for the process to run, it has a function that
gets called when it is time for the process to run.  When the
wait-function of a simple process becomes true, and the scheduler
notices it, the simple process's function is called in the scheduler's
own stack group.  Since a simple process does not have any stack group
of its own, it can't save control state in between calls; any state
that it saves must be saved in data structure.

The only advantage of simple processes over normal processes is that
they use up less system overhead, since they can be scheduled without
the cost of resuming stack-groups.  They are intended as a special,
efficient mechanism for certain purposes.  For example, packets received
from the Chaosnet are examined and distributed to the proper receiver by
a simple process that wakes up whenever there are any packets in the
input buffer.  However, they are harder to use, because you can't save
state information across scheduling.  That is, when the simple process
is ready to wait again, it must return; it can't call <obj>process-wait</obj>
and continue to do something else later.  In fact, it is an error to
call <obj>process-wait</obj> from inside a simple process.  Another drawback to
simple processes is that if the function signals an error, the scheduler
itself is broken and multiprocessing stops; this situation can be
repaired only by aborting, which blasts the process.  Also, when a
simple process is run, no other process is scheduled until it chooses to
return; so simple processes should never run for a long time without
returning.

Asking for the stack group of a simple process does not signal an error,
but returns the process's function instead.

Since a simple process cannot call <obj>process-wait</obj>, it needs some other
way to specify its wait-function.  To set the wait-function of a simple
process, use <obj>si:set-process-wait</obj> (see below).  So, when a simple
process wants to wait for a condition, it should call
<obj>si:set-process-wait</obj> to specify the condition, then return.
